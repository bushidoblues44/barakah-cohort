      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Hello,I'm a passionate person with a keen interest in how tech works and coding as a start.
        I have always been fascinated by the cool techy things they do in the movies and how they come together.
        My journey began with looking through python textbooks around 2019 and cisco basic courses back in secondary school, which sparked my
        desire to explore software engineering further, afew crash courses over the years and abit of practice, here i am to get a proper education on it.
